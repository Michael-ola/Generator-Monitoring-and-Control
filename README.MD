# IoT-Based Generator Monitoring and Control System

# About

## A device that utilizes Internet of Things Technology to redefine how Generators are used.

## Technologies Used:

## HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS

## MYSQL Database

## Node JS

## C++

## Arduino IDE

## It uses a web application with the following features:

## -Buttons to control the ON/OFF operation of the generator

## -A timer interface to control the scheduling of the generator operation e.g. ON after 30 minutes

## -A dial gauge that indicates the real-time fuel level of the generator

## -A chart of the monthly fuel usage for each year

## It uses a hardware device that comprises of:

## -An arduino ESP32 microcontroller

## -An ultrasonic sensor for fuel level detection

## -A temperature sensor for detecting the temperature of the generator room

## -Relays for controlling large voltage switching

## -Buck converter to power the device.
